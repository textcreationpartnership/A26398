            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>OU know beſt how unexpected your late <hi>Addreſs</hi> was to his <hi>Majeſty,</hi> who had contributed ſo much to the placing of moſt of you in your <hi>Epiſcopal Chairs,</hi> and would ſo willingly have believed you were of the ſame <hi>Loyal Temper</hi> you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in his <hi>Royal Brothers</hi> Reign. How his <hi>Majeſty reſented it,</hi> I hope you will reflect upon, becauſe you ought not to <hi>forget it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I cannot but foreſee that ſome, who have no kindneſs ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for your <hi>Order,</hi> or as you are <hi>Proteſtant Biſhops,</hi> may from this Provocation ſharpen their Style, and expoſe you with no leſs ſevere Reflections than ſuch as ſome have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly publiſhed againſt <hi>Diſſenters</hi> from <hi>Church and State;</hi> but it is not my <hi>Deſign</hi> to purſue ſuch <hi>Methods.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I doubt not but the <hi>Concern</hi> you have to preſerve the <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> as by <hi>Law Eſtabliſhed,</hi> and the <hi>Station</hi> you are in, were powerful Incitements to you to ſhew your Zeal for the <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> you profeſs, and to ſhew your <hi>Paſtoral</hi> Care: But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in <hi>Prudence</hi> or upon <hi>Neceſſity</hi> you were obliged to take this <hi>Courſe,</hi> or uſe ſuch <hi>Expreſſions</hi> to your <hi>Sovereign</hi> (who in all Reſpects might challenge another ſort of Duty from you) is what I crave leave to <hi>Expoſtulate</hi> with your <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That your <hi>Lordſhips</hi> are endowed with a plentiful ſhare of <hi>Learning,</hi> is not to be denied; and that you have here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore in <hi>Times of trial</hi> manifeſted not only your <hi>Loyalty,</hi> but your <hi>Zeal</hi> for the <hi>Perſon</hi> of the <hi>King,</hi> I will not diſpute: But that in this late <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>npreſidented Action</hi> your <hi>Lordſhips</hi> did ſo well <hi>ponder</hi> and <hi>conſider</hi> all the <hi>Prudential Rules</hi> that were requiſite to govern ſo bold <hi>an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertaking,</hi> is what
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:99707:3"/>many are <hi>unſatisfied</hi> in; ſince to ſome, and that no ſmall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of them that <hi>wiſh well</hi> to the <hi>Church of England,</hi> your <hi>Procedure</hi> is both <hi>adjudged Diſloyal</hi> and <hi>Prejudicial</hi> to your <hi>Intereſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your <hi>Lordſhips</hi> cannot but know, that it is the <hi>undoubted Prerogative</hi> of the <hi>King,</hi> to <hi>Summon</hi> and <hi>Diſſolve Parliaments</hi> at his Pleaſure: It is a <hi>Fundamental</hi> of the <hi>Monarchy</hi> never diſputed but by the <hi>Black Parliament.</hi> And it is as much his <hi>Prerogative</hi> to declare for what <hi>Purpoſe he convenes</hi> them. This has been uſually <hi>inſerted</hi> in the body of the <hi>Writ,</hi> or declared in the <hi>Speeches</hi> of the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Lord Chancellor</hi> at the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What then can hinder, but that our <hi>Great</hi> and <hi>Generous King,</hi> who is above all mean Arts of <hi>Diſſimulation,</hi> may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while before the iſſuing out of his <hi>Writs,</hi> acquaint his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects with ſome Matters he intends to <hi>inſiſt</hi> upon in his <hi>ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Parliament?</hi> None ſurely can <hi>cenſure</hi> this <hi>timely notice,</hi> as contrary to any <hi>known Law,</hi> but rather as an open <hi>Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of a <hi>Prince</hi> that conſults the <hi>Public Good</hi> of his People <hi>abſtractedly</hi> from the ſingle Concerns of any <hi>Party;</hi> for by this <hi>timely notice</hi> mens Minds will be better <hi>prepared</hi> to conſider the Reaſons his <hi>Majeſty</hi> lays down, why he wiſheth and expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a <hi>Compliance:</hi> Yet this neither <hi>abridgeth</hi> the <hi>Electors</hi> of their free <hi>Choice,</hi> nor can <hi>deprive</hi> the <hi>Members</hi> when convened, of their due <hi>Liberty</hi> of Debate.</p>
            <p>It would be no ſmall Fault in me to expreſs the <hi>Motives</hi> which induced his <hi>Majeſty</hi> to emit his <hi>Gracious Declaration</hi> in other <hi>words</hi> than they are <hi>compoſed</hi> in; and ſince your <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips</hi> are unwilling they ſhould be <hi>publiſhed</hi> in our <hi>Churches,</hi> I will here inſert them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We humbly thank</hi> Almighty God, <hi>it is and hath of long time been</hi> Our <hi>conſtant</hi> Senſe <hi>and</hi> Opinion, (<hi>which upon divers occaſions</hi> We <hi>have declared</hi>) <hi>that</hi> Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence <hi>ought not to be conſtrained, nor</hi> People <hi>forced in Matters of meer</hi> Religion. <hi>It has ever been directly
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:99707:3"/>contrary to Our</hi> Inclination, <hi>as we think it is to the</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt <hi>of</hi> Government, <hi>which it deſtroys by</hi> ſpoiling Trade, depopulating Countries, <hi>and</hi> diſcouraging Strangers; <hi>And finally, that it never</hi> obtained the End <hi>for which it was employed. And in this</hi> We <hi>are the more confirmed by the</hi> Reflections <hi>we have made upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the Four laſt</hi> Reigns, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In which it is <hi>obvious</hi> to all the unprejudiced, and thoſe that are not <hi>Malecontents,</hi> that the great Deſign of the <hi>King</hi> is, that a true and laſting <hi>Brotherly Affection</hi> and <hi>Harmony</hi> may be conciliated amongſt all his <hi>Subjects,</hi> how different ſoever in particular Sentiments of <hi>Religion;</hi> that the Brambles and thorny Shrubs of Diſcord may be <hi>ſtubbed</hi> up, which have ſo overſpread his <hi>Dominions,</hi> and that by <hi>Freedom, Liberty,</hi> and <hi>Security</hi> from moleſtation in purſuing mens <hi>Religious Worſhip,</hi> they may be at eaſe, and encouraged quietly to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue their ſeveral <hi>Vocations,</hi> either to live Hoſpitably upon their Eſtates in all happy accord one with another, or by the <hi>Encreaſe of Trade</hi> enrich the whole Kingdom; by which ſingle <hi>Liberty of Conſcience</hi> our <hi>Neighboring Commonwealth</hi> hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpered to ſuch a degree, that it is not to be wondred at, that a <hi>People</hi> wiſe enough to know their own <hi>Intereſt,</hi> ſhould, by all the <hi>Arts</hi> they can uſe, <hi>divert</hi> the Subjects here from <hi>cloſing</hi> with the <hi>King</hi> in ſo publickly beneficial a <hi>Deſign,</hi> which to the ſhame of our weak Intellectuals, will be the ineſtimable loſs of the <hi>Wealth</hi> and <hi>Renown</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> if we readily and Vigorouſly concur not with his <hi>Majeſties</hi> Deſire. Beſides, if an Unjuſt <hi>Peace</hi> ought to be preferred before a moſt Juſt <hi>War,</hi> this Method carries with it a moral <hi>Certainty,</hi> that when this <hi>Liberty</hi> according to his <hi>Majeſties</hi> Declaration is Eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by <hi>Act of Parliament,</hi> there will never be occaſion or <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>m<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brage</hi> of diſquieting the <hi>Government</hi> upon that account, which will be a <hi>Felicity</hi> our <hi>Fathers</hi> would have purchaſed at the rate of ſome hundred of <hi>Subſidies;</hi> ſince I believe moſt are by this time <hi>convinced,</hi> that the <hi>rigorous</hi> Conſtraint of <hi>Conſcience</hi> was
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:99707:4"/>one of the primary <hi>Cauſes,</hi> whereby <hi>Ambitious</hi> and deſigning Men brought about the <hi>Subverſion</hi> of the <hi>Monarchy,</hi> and the infinite effuſion of Blood and Treaſure.</p>
            <p>I foreſee your <hi>Lordſhips</hi> will object, That Two <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> have declar'd their Judgments againſt <hi>Toleration,</hi> and the <hi>late King</hi> of Bleſſed Memory yielded to them, againſt his public <hi>Declaration</hi> from <hi>Breda,</hi> and his actual granting of <hi>Indulgence</hi> afterward, and his <hi>Reſolutions</hi> to adhere to it: But your <hi>Lordſhips</hi> know the Grounds of both. As to the Firſt, he was <hi>won</hi> to it by his willingneſs to <hi>gratifie</hi> the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity</hi> of thoſe, whom He and his <hi>Bleſſed Father</hi> had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced to be ſuch <hi>Loyal Sufferers</hi> with and for the <hi>Royal Family;</hi> and the <hi>neceſſity</hi> of <hi>Supplies</hi> may well be judg'd to have conſtrain'd him to comply with the Latter.</p>
            <p>But hence it no ways follows, that a <hi>Vote</hi> or <hi>Addreſs</hi> of One or Both <hi>Houſes</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> ſhould be any ſufficient <hi>Ground</hi> for your paſſing your <hi>Sentence</hi> upon the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> and his <hi>Diſpenſing Power:</hi> For where the <hi>Judges</hi> have <hi>determined</hi> the Point of Law, it, at leaſt in your Lordſhips, ſeems to be <hi>Extrajudicial acting</hi> out of your Dioceſe, and to be the <hi>aſſuming</hi> a <hi>Power</hi> I never read that your <hi>Lordſhips Predeceſſors</hi> challeng'd.</p>
            <p>To have declared it to have been againſt your <hi>Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> or your <hi>Religion,</hi> had been ſomething modeſt; but to <hi>Arraign</hi> the <hi>Legality</hi> of the <hi>King</hi>'s Proceedings, in any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, is ſomething with the <hi>boldeſt:</hi> eſpecially upon ſuch a <hi>Ground,</hi> that One or Two <hi>Parliaments</hi> had given their <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> againſt the like. For your <hi>Lordſhips</hi> know, it is not beyond <hi>our Age,</hi> and ſo cannot eaſily be forgot, that the <hi>Votes</hi> of the <hi>Lower Houſe</hi> paſſed for a <hi>Bill</hi> of <hi>Secluſion</hi> of our <hi>Gracious King;</hi> yet I hope you will not think thoſe ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to <hi>engraft</hi> an Argument upon for the <hi>Legality</hi> of that Vote; However it ſeems that you that are againſt the <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſing Power,</hi> would inſinuate, that a <hi>Vote</hi> of One or Both Houſes is ſufficient to <hi>ſuperſede</hi> a Prerogative of the King, and will not allow that <hi>His Majeſty</hi> may <hi>diſpence</hi> with ſome <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Laws,</hi> which is one of the Flowers that not only <hi>adorn,</hi> but make up the <hi>Crown.</hi>

            <p>I now beg leave to enquire of your <hi>Lordſhips</hi> by what <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> or <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion you can diſobey the <hi>King</hi>'s poſitive Command in reading or cauſing to be read his <hi>Gracious Declaration,</hi> no ways <hi>inconſiſtent</hi> with the <hi>Laws of God,</hi> Chriſtian Charity, or the Practice of ſeveral <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries?</hi> I have indeed heard of one <hi>Miniſter,</hi> who, upon King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt's commanding the Publiſhing the <hi>Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> for Liberty of ſome Lawful <hi>Recreations</hi> and <hi>Exerciſes</hi> on <hi>Sundays</hi> after Even-Prayer, commonly called <hi>the Book of Sports,</hi> told his <hi>Congregation,</hi> That in <hi>Obedience</hi> to the <hi>King</hi>'s Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands he had read it to them; but withal tells them, That <hi>God Almighty</hi> had given Command to <hi>remember to keep holy the Sabboth-day.</hi> But this Command of the <hi>King</hi> hath nothing in it againſt Divine or Moral Precepts: And your <hi>Lordſhips</hi> well know what <hi>Power</hi> the <hi>Laws</hi> give the <hi>King</hi> in Point of <hi>Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy,</hi> which only his <hi>ſteadineſs</hi> to the Principles of <hi>Juſtice, Honor</hi> and <hi>Generoſity,</hi> hinders him to make uſe of. Now it is well known, that as <hi>Sheriffs, Mayors,</hi> and <hi>Bayliffs</hi> are the King's <hi>Secular Officers</hi> to publiſh his <hi>Civil Mandates;</hi> ſo <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, Vicars,</hi> and <hi>Curates</hi> are, under your <hi>Lordſhips,</hi> the King's <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Officers,</hi> to publiſh, according to the <hi>Rubrick,</hi> what is ſent to them by the King or their Ordinary; and as in the One ſo in the Other the <hi>Law</hi> inflicts a <hi>Puniſhment</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Diſobeyers:</hi> And it hath not fallen under my Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that any <hi>Biſhops</hi> have refuſed to <hi>obey</hi> the <hi>King's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,</hi> when by any <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Council</hi> the King enjoyned the Clergy to publiſh any matter in their Churches or Chappels; but upon <hi>Refuſal</hi> a ſevere <hi>Puniſhment</hi> followed, unleſs Pardon'd.</p>
            <p>But I foreſee your <hi>Lordſhips</hi> will offer in excuſe for your ſelves, That this <hi>Declaration</hi> is againſt the <hi>Being</hi> of the Church of <hi>England</hi> as Eſtabliſhed by Law; a <hi>Toleration</hi> being <hi>inconſiſtent</hi> with a <hi>National</hi> Church-Government.</p>
            <p>To this I reply, Firſt, That if it had been only for the <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Expreſſions</hi> in the <hi>Declaration</hi> relating to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> it might have been <hi>adviſeable</hi> to have <hi>publiſhed</hi> it: Therefore, leſt the <hi>Import</hi> of them ſhould be forgot, I ſhall inſert the words.</p>
            <pb n="8" facs="tcp:99707:5"/>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>In the firſt place We do declare, That We will</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect <hi>and</hi> Maintain <hi>Our</hi> Archbiſhops, Biſhops, <hi>and</hi> Clergy, <hi>and all other Our Subjects of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>in the free</hi> Exerciſe <hi>of their</hi> Religion <hi>as by Law Eſtabliſhed, and in the</hi> quiet <hi>and</hi> full <hi>Enjoyment of all their</hi> Poſſeſſions, <hi>without any</hi> Moleſtation <hi>or</hi> Diſturbance <hi>whatſoever.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This was a freſh <hi>Aſſurance</hi> of the <hi>King's Protection,</hi> and <hi>His Majeſty</hi>'s firſt Care; but being joyned with <hi>Liberty</hi> of <hi>Conſcience</hi> in the Exerciſe of Religion, and the <hi>ſuſpending</hi> of the Execution of all manner of <hi>Penal Laws</hi> in matters <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical,</hi> this is the <hi>Mors in Ollâ.</hi> But ſome it ſeems muſt be flattered with hopes that they ſhall be <hi>Indulged,</hi> becauſe <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> but the Scourge muſt ſtill be reſerved for <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholics:</hi> Therefore, ſince They, as well as all other <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> are to be <hi>Partakers</hi> of the <hi>King's Royal Clemency,</hi> the Declaration muſt not be publiſhed. This, I humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, is the true Ground of the <hi>Refuſal,</hi> whatever is <hi>pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:</hi> However, from this <hi>partiality</hi> to <hi>Proteſtant Diſſenters</hi> the Arguments for the Inconſiſtency of a <hi>Toleration</hi> with the Being of a <hi>National Church</hi> wholly vaniſheth; for your <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips</hi> do well know, that this Indulgence neither <hi>deprives</hi> your <hi>Lordſhips</hi> of your <hi>Dignities,</hi> nor <hi>robs</hi> You or the <hi>Inferior Clergy</hi> of their <hi>Poſſeſſions;</hi> nor doth it hinder the free Exerciſe of your Religion, but only <hi>abridgeth</hi> ſome <hi>Branches</hi> of <hi>Viſitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> and <hi>reſtrains</hi> the inflicting <hi>Penal Laws</hi> upon <hi>Abſenters</hi> from the <hi>Churches,</hi> and impairs the <hi>Severity</hi> of <hi>Compulſion,</hi> and by <hi>experience</hi> already it is found that the Congregations of the Church of <hi>England</hi> are not viſibly <hi>thinner</hi> for it; for <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, public Prayer,</hi> and the <hi>Adminiſtration</hi> of the <hi>Sacraments</hi> (the <hi>Eſſentials</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi>) remain <hi>untouch'd</hi> now that it is put in <hi>Execution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I now beg that your <hi>Lordſhips</hi> will conſider, Whether this <hi>diſobeying</hi> the <hi>King</hi> be a likelier means to <hi>preſerve</hi> your <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips</hi> in your <hi>Places</hi> and <hi>Dignities,</hi> and the Church of <hi>England</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:99707:5"/>in its <hi>Luſtre,</hi> than your <hi>Obedience</hi> would have been? You are not ignorant how <hi>Diſſenters</hi> have preſs'd you, that the <hi>Loyalty</hi> of the Church of <hi>England</hi> was not much to be boaſted of; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſince the <hi>Reformation</hi> (except in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s Reign, and about the <hi>Indulgence</hi> in King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second's time) it was never put to the <hi>Trial</hi> by their <hi>Lawful Sovereigns</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding any thing contrary to its <hi>Eſtabliſhment;</hi> and how the <hi>Members</hi> of the Church deported themſelves in <hi>that Queens Reign,</hi> is too notorious to be deny'd, when they firſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor'd the <hi>Excluding</hi> her from the Crown, and after by <hi>Wyat</hi>'s <hi>Rebellion</hi> to have torn the <hi>Scepter</hi> out of her hand; and to what <hi>Straits</hi> they would have reduced King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second till he quit the <hi>Indulgence,</hi> is very evident: Therefore it hath been frequently objected, That if any King of <hi>England</hi> ſhould abridge the Church of any of its <hi>Liberties</hi> and <hi>Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges,</hi> it would inſtantly appear how long-liv'd its <hi>Loyalty</hi> would remain.</p>
            <p>It is, <hi>my Lords,</hi> by this your Act you have <hi>confirm'd</hi> all their <hi>Suggeſtions,</hi> and that in a matter wherein your <hi>Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences</hi> were not concern'd in the <hi>approving</hi> or <hi>diſapproving</hi> the matter contain'd in the Declaration; for you were only en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned to publiſh it as the <hi>King's Declaration,</hi> not <hi>your own.</hi> And can your <hi>Lordſhips,</hi> upon <hi>ſedate</hi> thoughts, think the publiſhing this was a <hi>Crime</hi> of that Nature, that it <hi>neceſſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> you to chooſe (as in ſuch Caſes is generally alleged) to pleaſe <hi>God</hi> rather than your <hi>King?</hi> Surely if the King had commanded any <hi>ſingle Perſon</hi> of you to have read it, you would not have <hi>ſcrupl'd</hi> to have done it; but now, it ſeems, <hi>Nos numeri Sumus</hi> came into your Heads, and ſo you were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to try <hi>who</hi> ſhould be <hi>Supreme Governor</hi> over the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Methinks I hear the ſad and loud <hi>Groans</hi> of Thouſands of thoſe who are deſirous to preſerve their <hi>Religion,</hi> and the <hi>King's Clemency to the Church,</hi> and <hi>demonſtrate</hi> their <hi>Loyalty</hi> to <hi>His Majeſty,</hi> bemoaning your <hi>Zeal,</hi> that in a matter of no greater moment you ſhould, as much as in you lay, <hi>diſhonor</hi> the <hi>King</hi> before his People, bid <hi>Defiance</hi> to his <hi>Authority, Libel</hi> his <hi>Judges,</hi> forfeit all <hi>Pretences</hi> to his <hi>Gracious Protection</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:99707:6"/>of your ſelves or the Church of <hi>England,</hi> render your ſelves <hi>obnoxious</hi> to the Puniſhments which the Laws have provided for ſuch as diſobey the <hi>King,</hi> and not only involv'd <hi>your ſelves</hi> in <hi>this danger,</hi> but <hi>all the Clergy of your Dioceſe:</hi> So that all Conſiderate Men tremble to think what <hi>fatal Conſequences</hi> this <hi>obſtinate</hi> Act may produce; eſpecially when they conſider what great Sums the <hi>Clergy</hi> paid in King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth's time to buy off the <hi>Praemunire</hi> incurr'd by ſubmitting to Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Woolſey</hi>'s <hi>Legatine Power</hi> without the King's <hi>expreſs Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance</hi> under the Great Seal; and yet your Lordſhips have been ſo hardy as to <hi>refuſe</hi> to ſubmit to the <hi>King's Commands</hi> in a matter next of any thing to a <hi>Paſſive Obedience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this <hi>Act,</hi> as much as in you lies, you have endeavored to repreſent the <hi>Church of England</hi> in general as <hi>Diſobedient,</hi> and conſequently <hi>Diſloyal;</hi> and if the <hi>King's Clemency</hi> and <hi>Mercy</hi> tranſcend not your <hi>Deſerts,</hi> have <hi>abſolved</hi> him from his <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe</hi> of <hi>Protecting</hi> this <hi>Church,</hi> when, at leaſt, ſo great a part of the <hi>Engliſh Hierarchy</hi> have led the <hi>Van</hi> of Diſobedience, and loudly <hi>proclaimed</hi> you are none of his <hi>Dutifulleſt</hi> Subjects.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Miſchief</hi> to the <hi>Church of England</hi> is not like to fall only upon your Heads: You have lifted up your <hi>Voice</hi> like a loud <hi>Speaking Trumpet,</hi> to raiſe a <hi>Diſobedient,</hi> if not a <hi>Rebellious</hi> Spirit of <hi>Oppoſition</hi> againſt the <hi>King</hi> through all his <hi>Dominions;</hi> You have <hi>enflamed</hi> the Minds of the <hi>Multitude,</hi> to <hi>oppoſe</hi> the <hi>King</hi>'s Deſires, ſince they find you have been ſo <hi>hardy</hi> to diſpute the <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Legality</hi> of this Act of State in his own <hi>Cloſet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your <hi>Lordſhips</hi> have <hi>divided</hi> your ſelves from a <hi>Loyal, Judicious</hi> and <hi>Religious</hi> part of the <hi>Church</hi> you profeſs your ſelves Members of; and we ſhall hereafter hear of the Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of a <hi>Fanatical</hi> and <hi>Loyal</hi> Party of that <hi>Church:</hi> for I hope you will find there is a <hi>Sound, Peaceable,</hi> and <hi>numerous</hi> part of that <hi>Church,</hi> that will <hi>Obey</hi> the <hi>King</hi> in this Matter, and own it their <hi>Duty</hi> to obey for Conſcience ſake, and be willing to live <hi>Charitably</hi> with their Fellow-Subjects of different <hi>Perſuaſions</hi> in Matters of <hi>Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You have <hi>divided</hi> your ſelves from the whole Body of <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters,</hi> towards whom tho' you expreſs ſome <hi>tenderneſs,</hi> when
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:99707:6"/>the Matter comes to be <hi>Debated</hi> in a <hi>Parliament;</hi> yet they cannot but ſee how <hi>unwillingly</hi> you are <hi>drawn</hi> to any <hi>Compliance</hi> with them: whereas you find our <hi>Gracious King</hi> can <hi>forget</hi> and <hi>forgive</hi> his greateſt <hi>Enemies,</hi> for no other End, but to ſhew his <hi>Innate Compaſſion</hi> of them, and demonſtrate to all the World, that it is his <hi>Principle,</hi> That <hi>Conſcience</hi> is not to be forced.</p>
            <p>As to your fear that <hi>Popery</hi> will be <hi>propagated</hi> more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually by taking off the <hi>Teſt</hi> and <hi>Penal Laws,</hi> by this <hi>Act,</hi> I do not ſee you have made any great <hi>Blockade</hi> to it: For by this <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertaking</hi> you have declared your ſelves Enemies to the <hi>King</hi> and his <hi>Religion,</hi> and to all ſorts of <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> and ſo have leſſened your <hi>Intereſt</hi> with the <hi>King,</hi> and great numbers of the People; and by the <hi>joyning</hi> of both <hi>Powers</hi> againſt you, becauſe they may juſtly ſuſpect you <hi>hug</hi> the <hi>Darling Perſecuting Spirit,</hi> what can you expect will be the <hi>upſhot,</hi> but that both Parties will ſet themſelves more than ever to keep you all under, and your <hi>Lordſhips</hi> wanting the <hi>King</hi> for your <hi>Head,</hi> and the <hi>Diſſenting Proteſtants</hi> for your <hi>Aſſiſtant Brethren?</hi> If the taking off the <hi>Teſt</hi> and <hi>Penal Laws</hi> be carried againſt you, it will be very late to flie to the <hi>King's Mercy</hi> for your enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Honors</hi> and <hi>Profits</hi> you now poſſeſs, and how your <hi>Deſervings,</hi> and your <hi>Power</hi> to defend your ſelves may be <hi>weakned</hi> in the Interval of Time betwixt <hi>Now</hi> and a <hi>Proteſtant Succeſſor,</hi> I will not undertake to divine. But that <hi>Popery</hi> can advance many Steps more, tho' his <hi>Majeſties Gracious Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> had been <hi>Publiſhed</hi> or ſuch a <hi>Toleration</hi> as by it is <hi>granted,</hi> and now put in <hi>execution,</hi> were Eſtabliſhed by Act of <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> than it doth now, I think few <hi>unbiaſſed</hi> Perſons will be induced to believe; ſince it will be contrary to the very <hi>Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Grounds</hi> of the <hi>Declaration,</hi> that any other <hi>Force</hi> can be uſed but that of <hi>Argument</hi> and <hi>Perſuaſion,</hi> and by the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs</hi> hath been made theſe four years in <hi>Reconciling</hi> Perſons to the <hi>Church;</hi> that now we may make a very probable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation how much may be effected in this <hi>Age,</hi> upon <hi>Perſons</hi> ſo averſe and reſolved againſt the entertaining Doctrins and Ceremonies, their Education and other Motives have ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced them againſt.</p>
